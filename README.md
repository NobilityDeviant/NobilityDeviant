Hello. I am Nobility. I also go by NobilityDev and now NobilityDeviant.

I like to code in Java. I have about 8 years of Java coding experience.
I have recently learned Kotlin as well. About 1 year of experience.

I have about 3 years in creating Android apps as well. XML. Jetpack Compose, RXJava, Kotlin etc

I have always loved dabbling in code from C#, PHP, Javascript, Typescript, Python, Kotlin and a little bit of Dart. 

My primary focus is Kotlin & Java though.
