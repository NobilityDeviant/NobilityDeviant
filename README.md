Hello. I am Nobility. I also go by NobilityDev and now NobilityDeviant.

I like to code in Java. I have about 8 years of Java coding experience.

I have recently learned Kotlin as well. About 2 years of experience so far :). Kotlin is my new baby.

I have about 3 years in creating Android apps. UI Creation with XML/Jetpack Compose, RXJava, Coroutines, MVVM etc.

I have always loved dabbling in code from C#, PHP, Javascript, Typescript, Python and a little bit of Dart. 

My primary focus is Kotlin & Java though. The other languages are not my specialty for now.

New Goal: Learn c# and Python more by the end of 2024.

I am currently finishing my android project. I don't have time for much else.
