Hello. I am Nobility. I also go by NobilityDev and now NobilityDeviant.
I like to code in Java. I have about 7 years of Java coding experience. I am currently learning Kotlin as well.
I have about 2 years creating Android apps as well.
I have always loved dabbling in code from C#, PHP, Javascript, HTML and a little bit of Dart. My primary focus is Java though.

Starting from Runescape Private Servers and moving on to bigger and better things.
I have always been a bit of a recluse, but I think it's time to branch out a little bit more.

I am currently looking for projects to work on.
